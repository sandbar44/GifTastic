# GifTastic
Giphy generator

### Overview
Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

### Details

* Create an array of strings, each one related to a topic. Save it to a variable called `topics`.

* Take the topics in this array and create buttons.

* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

* A form takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the `topics` array. A function call takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
